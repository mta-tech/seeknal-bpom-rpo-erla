# Forecast Guide (BPOM Forecaster) — ETS Holt-Winters, SQL templates, eligibility gates, quality labels

> **v5.0 — 2026-07-10.** Engine: **ETS seasonal (Holt-Winters)** — a deliberate tradeoff:
> the forecast varies per month at the cost of lower accuracy than a flat median (FC2f r3
> spec). Computed on demand from `t_produk_3_erba`/`t_btp_3_erba` — there is no pre-computed table.
> **Consistency is critical:** a differently-built SQL across turns produces a visibly different
> answer, not just a different level. Follow §2's reuse rule for follow-ups and the template below
> exactly for new questions.

## §1 Data Source & SQL Template

| Param | Value |
|---|---|
| Tables | `t_produk_3_erba` (pangan olahan), `t_btp_3_erba` (BTP) |
| Date col | `tanggal_bayar` |
| Baseline | `>= '2022-09-01'` |
| Exclusions | `trader_id::bigint NOT IN (5, 17, 50, 85)` (t_produk_3_erba only) |
| System | ERBA only — ERLA's CV is always too high |

`t_produk_3_erba` columns are TEXT: cast `::timestamp`/`::bigint`. `t_btp_3_erba` is
native, no casts. **Production only, never Neon** (Neon is ~20x smaller and looks
artificially erratic).

```sql
SELECT date_trunc('month', tanggal_bayar::timestamp) AS x,
       COUNT(DISTINCT produk_id)                     AS y
FROM   <table from §3>
WHERE  tanggal_bayar::timestamp >= '2022-09-01'
  AND  trader_id::bigint NOT IN (5, 17, 50, 85)      -- t_produk_3_erba only
  AND  <series filter from §3, if any>
  AND  tanggal_bayar::timestamp < date_trunc('month', CURRENT_DATE)
GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1
```

The SQL's job is to **shape the series** — the forecast numbers themselves come from the engine
(`run_forecast`), never from this query or any arithmetic on it. Turning an `execute_sql`
monthly series into a projection yourself (growth rates, last-value + drift, any hand-computed
estimate) is the manual-forecast failure mode: the engine call is the whole point of the skill,
and an engine refusal is presented as-is rather than replaced by a self-computed number.
Default Y =
`COUNT(DISTINCT produk_id)`; use `COUNT(*)` only if the user says "jumlah transaksi/record".
Default grain = monthly. No JOINs, no `generate_series`, no recursive CTE (the tool rejects
these). Univariate only.

## §2 Method — ETS seasonal, deterministic

A single fit (trend + seasonal, `seasonal_periods=12`) on a **fixed 36-month trailing window**
(non-adaptive — consistency is prioritised over marginal MAPE; shorter series simply use all
their data), forecast natively — never recursive self-append. Same input → same output, always.
The point **varies per month** (intentional, see §6). Bounds: `sigma * sqrt(min(h,2))`, z=1.2816
(80%)/1.9600 (95%) — widening over periods 1→2, then flat. Never show `sigma`,
`sub_type`, or raw field names; say "Rentang Realistis" (80%) / "Rentang
Ekstrem" (95%).

**Follow-up consistency:** same series, different horizon or clarifying question
→ reuse the prior turn's exact SQL; do not rebuild it. Rebuilding risks a
different-but-"valid" query and a visibly different answer for what the user considers the same
question. Only rebuild for an explicitly different series/grain/filter.

## §3 Eligibility & series registry

Refuse when history < 10 periods or CV > 0.8. Volume alone never triggers a refusal — it widens
the range and lowers the quality label instead.

| Series | Table | Filter |
|---|---|---|
| Total ERBA | t_produk_3_erba | none |
| NIE Terbit | t_produk_3_erba | status IN ('0999','0906','9999'), jenis_permohonan IN ('301','305') |
| BTP ERBA | t_btp_3_erba | none |
| MR (303) / MT (302) / Tinggi (301) / TinggiNotif (304) | t_produk_3_erba | kategori_dokumen = '303'/'302'/'301'/'304' |

**Never eligible** (CV always too high; event-driven, not recurring): ERLA
(any), NIE Dicabut, Komitmen Dibatalkan. Multi-series questions → check each
independently; one ineligible sub-series does not block an eligible one.

## §4 Quality label (walk-forward backtest MAPE)

| MAPE | Label | Keyakinan |
|---|---|---|
| ≤15% | BAIK | Tinggi |
| 15–25% | CUKUP | Sedang |
| 25–35% | LEMAH | Rendah — anomaly auto-attached |
| >35% | TOLAK | Rendah, strong warning — anomaly auto-attached |
| n/a | UNKNOWN | Sedang — don't overstate either way |

One label covers the whole projection (MAPE is one number for the fit), even
though the point varies by month.

## §5 Output & limitations

Read `run_forecast`'s markdown and compose prose around it — do not invent a new structure. Say
"Proyeksi" rather than "Forecast", and never show raw CV/`sigma`/`sub_type`/`modified_z`/MAD or
`window_selection` internals — a one-line Metodologi summary is enough unless the user asks for
detail.

- The seasonal shape is not guaranteed correct — a historically-high month may not
  be high this year; the quality label is the honest trust signal, shape included.
- March historically shows elevated error for ERBA — flag it when it is a target month.
- Bounds cap at h=2 and stop widening — validated, not a shortcut.
- **CSV Store Contract:** one question = one stored CSV = the data behind the answer. On success
  `run_forecast` self-uploads ONE **combined** CSV (historical + projection in one file, with a
  `kind` column) — tool-owned and complete; the agent does **not** export separately. Only on
  refusal/fallback (no combined CSV) does the agent export the historical series. The 36-step
  horizon cap is silent inside the tool — stating it in the answer is the agent's job.
- **Transparency & consistency (general):** every projected period appears as its own row (point +
  bounds); multi-series → per-series labelled blocks; the CSVs cover the same full horizon as the
  answer. Same question, same series, same horizon → identical numbers in any session
  (deterministic engine); the only legitimate difference is data drift — stamp the as-of date.

## §6 Anomaly detection (separate tool, awareness only)

`detect_anomaly(sql)` — same 2-column contract, never removes data, never forecasts. It fires
automatically when a forecast's MAPE > 25%, or on direct request ("apakah ada anomali...").
Always state that flagged points were **not removed**.
